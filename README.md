# Banks in England Trust by Utilizing Data Science and Computational Machine Learning Algorithms

This project proposal investigates the role of trust in the sustainability and resilience of England's banking sector. Using data from the World Values Survey (WVS), we apply machine learning algorithms to analyze key factors influencing trust in banks.

# Key Features
1. Proposed Algorithms
Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree
2. Proposed Data Source
World Values Survey (WVS)
3. Trust Factors
Age, financial satisfaction, income, life satisfaction, general trust, cash shortage
4. Proposed Results
Significant correlations found between trust and key variables.

# Proposed Tools 
1. Python
For data analysis and model building
2. Statistical & Visual Analysis
Effect plots and graphs to represent findings

# Proposed Conclusion
The findings provide insights for policymakers and banks to enhance customer trust and resilience in England's banking sector.
